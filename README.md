The agricultural sector faces unprecedented challenges due to climate change, pest infestations, and limited access to personalized advisory systems. Recent
advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like T5, BERT, and GPT, have shown
promise in knowledge retrieval, text generation, and summarization. These tech nologies can bridge the gap between complex agricultural knowledge and practical, 
farmer-friendly advice. Farmers AI leverages a fine-tuned T5 model (CropSeek LLM) and a Streamlit interface to deliver an intuitive platform that provides
contextual, reliable, and explainable agricultural solutions.
